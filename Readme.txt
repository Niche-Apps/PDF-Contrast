This is a simple Python app with gui to adjust the contrast of PDF files.
You can select a single file or a directory.
The app extracts the images from each PDF and increases the contrast the amount you specified. Then it recompiles the PDF and saves it in its original location.
Processed files will have _dark appended to the filename.
